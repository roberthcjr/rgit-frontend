# 🖥️ Tool Management Frontend — Modern and Responsive UI

This frontend application serves as the presentation layer for the Tool Management API. Built with **Next.js**, it provides a fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable React-based framework that supports both server-side rendering and static site generation.

The UI components are built using **shadcn/ui**, a modern and flexible component library designed for rapid and consistent UI development. Data fetching and state synchronization are handled by **TanStack Query** (formerly React Query), which significantly improves responsiveness by providing smart caching, background updates, and optimistic UI for queries and mutations.
